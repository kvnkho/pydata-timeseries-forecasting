    "In the first section, we saw how to scale `StatsForecast` on top of Spark, Dask, and Ray just by changing one line of code. When dealing with large data, we'll need to preprocess it also to get it in the same format. How do we prototype on small data, and scale it seamlessly? [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/) allows us to scale existing Python and Pandas code to Spark, Dask, or Ray just by changing the engine as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll preprocess the data shown in the previous section using Dask to speed it up. One of the advantages of Fugue is being able to decouple logic and execution. Code can be prototyped on the local system, and brought to the full scale when ready.\n",

The problem with this file is that it is very wide with around 2000 columns, but `StatsForecast` expects data in a long format where each data point is one row. Though this is a memory efficient way to store the data, it's unfriendly to work with for machine learning. We need to transform the data first."
